# 🎬 Netflix Clone

This project is a detailed **Netflix UI Clone** built using only **HTML and CSS**, designed to replicate the Netflix homepage layout and styling. It provides a simple way to practice front-end development while recreating a familiar streaming service interface.

## ✨ Features

The project includes a **fixed navigation bar** with the Netflix logo on the left and a user avatar on the right. A **banner section** highlights a featured show with its title, description, and action buttons (Play and My List). Below the banner, multiple **horizontal movie rows** are displayed, such as Netflix Originals, Trending Now, Top Rated, Action Movies, and Comedy Movies.  

Each row is fully **scrollable** with smooth horizontal scrolling. Movie posters have a **hover effect** that enlarges them slightly for a cinematic feel, while Netflix Originals use **larger posters** to stand out.
